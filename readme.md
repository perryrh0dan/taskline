## Description

By utilizing a simple and minimal usage syntax, that requires a flat learning curve, Taskline enables you to effectively manage your tasks and notes across multiple boards from within your terminal. All data is written atomically to the storage in order to prevent corruptions. At the moment there are two storage modules. The Local storage module where your task and are never shared with anyone or anything, or the firestore module, where your tasks are saved in your firestore database and can be shared across all your devices. Deleted items are automatically archived and can be inspected or restored at any moment.

Visit the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/perryrh0dan/taskline/blob/master/contributing.md#translating-documentation) to learn more on how to translate taskline or this document into more languages.

Come over to [Gitter](https://gitter.im/taskline/community?source=orgpage) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/perryrh0dan1) to share your thoughts on the project.

## Highlights

This project was heavily inspired by [taskbook](https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook). Due to the lack of some critical features mentioned below, I decided to rewrite the complete app in a more modern approach.

### Original 

- Organize tasks & notes to boards
- Board & timeline views
- Priority & favorite mechanisms
- Search & filter items
- Archive & restore deleted items
- Lightweight & fast
- Data written atomically to storage
- Custom storage location
- Progress overview
- Simple & minimal usage syntax
- Update notifications
- Configurable through `~/.taskline.json`
- Data is stored in JSON file at `~/.taskline/storage`

### New

- Modular data storage.
- Firestore module to save data in google firestore.
- Sync tasks across all your devices with firestore.
- Replaced Meow with commander.js
- Advanced duedate functionality
- Display loadingspinner while fetching network requests

```

### NPM

```bash
npm install --global @perryrh0dan/taskline
```

### Snapcraft

```bash
snap install taskline
snap alias taskline tl # set alias
```

**Note:** Due to the snap's strictly confined nature, both the storage & configuration files will be saved under the [ `$SNAP_USER_DATA` ](https://docs.snapcraft.io/reference/env) environment variable instead of the generic `$HOME` one.

# Views

### Board View

Invoking taskline without any options will display all saved items grouped into their respective boards.

<div align="center">
  <img alt="Boards" width="70%" src="media/header-boards.png"/>
</div>

### Timeline View

In order to display all items in a timeline view, based on their creation date, the `--timeline` / `-i` option can be used.

<div align="center">
  <img alt="Timeline View" width="70%" src="media/timeline.png"/>
</div>

## Configuration

To configure taskline navigate to the `~/.taskline.json` file and modify any of the options to match your own preference. To reset back to the default values, simply delete the config file from your home directory.

The following illustrates all the available options with their respective default values.

```json
{
  "language": "en",
  "tasklineDirectory": "~",
  "displayCompleteTasks": true,
  "displayProgressOverview": true,
  "storageModule": "local",
  "firestoreConfig": {
    "type": "",
    "project_id": "",
    "private_key_id": "",
    "private_key": "",
    "client_email": "",
    "client_id": "",
    "auth_uri": "",
    "token_uri": "",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "",
    "client_x509_cert_url": ""
  },
  "dateformat": "dd.mm.yyyy HH:MM",
  "theme": {
    "colors": {
      "pale": "grey",
      "error": "red",
      "task": {
        "priority": {
          "medium": "yellow",
          "high": "red"
        }
      },
      "icons": {
        "note": "blue",
        "success": "green",
        "star": "yellow",
        "progress": "blue",
        "pending": "magenta",
        "canceled": "red"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### In Detail

##### `tasklineDirectory`

- Type: `String`
- Default: `~`

Filesystem path where the storage will be initialized, i.e: `/home/username/the-cloud` or `~/the-cloud`

If left undefined the home directory `~` will be used and taskline will be set-up under `~/.taskline/` .

##### `displayCompleteTasks`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Display tasks that are marked as complete.

##### `displayProgressOverview`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`

Display progress overview below the timeline and board views.

##### `storageModule`

- Type: `Enum`
- Default: `local`
- Values: `local` , `firestore` , `git`

Choose the storage module.
- For the `firestore` module, the `firestoreConfig` is needed.
- For the `git` module, set the `gitStorageDirectory` option as shown below.

##### `gitStorageDirectory`

- Type: `String`
- Example: `D:\\test_repo`

Filesystem path where the Git storage repository will be initialized or used.  
If the directory does not contain a Git repository, one will be initialized automatically.

**Example configuration for Git storage in your `~/.taskline.json` file:**

```json
{
  "storageModule": "git",
  "gitStorageDirectory": "<your-git-storage-path>", // Path to your local Git repository
  ...
}
```
> **Tip:**  
> On **Windows**, use double backslashes in your path (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourName\\my-taskline-repo`).\
> On **macOS/Linux**, use forward slashes (e.g., `/home/yourname/my-taskline-repo`).

**Note:**  
To enable syncing across devices or with a remote server, your Git storage repository must be connected to a remote (such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).  
If no remote is configured, changes will only be saved locally and will not sync globally.

To add a remote to your Git storage directory, run:

```sh
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `<your-remote-url>` with the URL of your remote repository.

##### `firestoreConfig`

- Type: `Google Dienstkontoschl√ºssel`
- Default: `Empty`

Configuration of the firestore module.

##### `dateformat`

- Type: `String`
- Default: `dd.mm.yyyy HH:MM`

Dateformat used for duedate.

#### `theme`

Customize colors of all texts and icons. Available are all foreground colors of [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk#colors). More information under [Themes](#themes)

## Before flight

When you want to use the local storage module there is no further configuration need. When you want to use the firestore module follow this steps:

### Setup Firestore

1. Create a new Project on the google cloud platform.
2. Create a new service account for this project.
3. Download the authorization.json file and insert all the lines to the corresponding lines in the taskline configuration.

or follow this [instruction page](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#providing_credentials_to_your_application).

## Flight Manual

The following is a minor walkthrough containing a set of examples on how to use taskline.
In case you spotted an error or think that an example is not to clear enough and should be further improved, please feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/perryrh0dan/taskline/issues/new/choose) or [pull request](https://github.com/perryrh0dan/taskline/compare).

### Create Task

To create a new task use the `task` / `t` command with your task's description following right after.

```

> tl t "Improve documentation"

```

### Create Note

To create a new note use the `note` / `n` command with your note's body following right after.

```

> tl n "Mergesort worse-case O(nlogn)"

```

### Create Board

Boards are automatically initialized when creating a new task or note. To create one or more boards, use the `--board` / `-b` option, followed by a list of boardnames, after the description of the about-to-be created item. As a result the newly created item will belong to all of the given boards. By default, items that do not contain any board option are automatically added to the general purpose: `My Board` .

```

> tl t "Update contributing guidelines" -b coding,docs

```

### Check Task

To mark a task as complete/incomplete, use the `check` / `c` command followed by the ids of the target tasks. Note that the command will update to its opposite the `complete` status of the given tasks, thus checking a complete task will render it as pending and a pending task as complete. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out. Instead of listing all ids its also possible to specify id ranges.

```

> tl c (1,2,3 || 1-3)

```

### Begin Task

To mark a task as started/paused, use the `begin` / `b` command followed by the ids of the target tasks. The functionality of this command is the same as the one of the above described `check` command. When a task is in progress the elapsed time is measured.

```

> tl b 2,3

```

### Cancel Task

To mark a task as canceled/revived, use the `cancel` command followed by the ids of the target tasks. The functionality of this command is the same as the one of the above described `check` command.

```

> tl cancel 1-3,5,6

```


### Star Item

To mark one or more items as favorite, use the `star` / `s` command followed by the ids of the target items. The functionality of this command is the same as the one of the above described `check` command.

```

> tl s 1,3

```

### Copy Item Description

To copy to your system's clipboard the description of one or more items, use the `copy` / `y` command followed by the ids of the target items. Note that the command will also include the newline character as a separator to each pair of adjacent copied descriptions, thus resulting in a clear and readable stack of sentences on paste.

```

> tl y (1,2,3 || 1-3)

```

### Display Boards

Invoking taskline without any commands and options will display all of saved items grouped into their respective boards.

```

> tl

```

### Display Timeline

In order to display all items in a timeline view, based on their creation date, the `timeline` / `i` command can be used.

```

> tl i

```

### Set Priority

To set a priority level for a task while initializing it, use the `--priority` / `-p` option followed by the priority. Priority can be an integer of value `1` , `2` or `3` . Note that all tasks by default are created with a normal priority: `1` .

- `1` - Normal priority
- `2` - Medium priority
- `3` - High priority

```

> tl t "Fix issue `#42` " -b coding -p 3

```

To update the priority level of a specific task after its creation, use the `priority` / `p` command along with the id of the target tasks and an integer of value `1` , `2` or `3` .

```

> tl p (1,2,3,23 2 || 1-3,23)

```

### Set Duedate

To set a duedate for a task while initializing it, use the `--due` / `-d` option followed by the duedate. Duedate must be a date of the format specified in the configuration file under dateformat or use the defined humanized date structure described below. Default is `dd.mm.yyyy HH:MM`. Note that all tasks by default have no duedate.

```

> tl t "Solve puzzle" -b coding -d 23.08.2019

```

To update the duedate of a specified task after its creation, use the `due` command along with the id of the target tasks and an date. The `due` command has no available shorter alias.

```

> tl due 1,2,23 "15.09.2019 13:15"

```

The time left before the duedate is displayed humanized instead of the age of an task right next to the description.

#### Verbal date format

Instead of using normal dates its also possible to use verbal dates like `today`, `tonight`, `tomorrow` or `next monday`.

### Move Item

To move items to one or more boards, use the `move` / `m` command, followed by the target items ids and the name of the destination boards. The default `My board` can be accessed through the `myboard` keyword.

```

> tl m 1,2 myboard,reviews

```

### Delete Item

To delete one or more items, use the `delete` / `d` command followed by the ids of the target items. Note that deleted items are automatically archived, and can be inspected or restored at any moment. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.

```

> tl d 1,2

```

### Delete Checked Tasks

To delete/clear all complete tasks at once across all boards, use the `clear` command. Note that all deleted tasks are automatically archived, and can be inspected or restored at any moment. In order to discourage any possible accidental usage, the `clear` command has no available shorter alias.

```

> tl clear

```

### Display Archive

To display all archived items, use the `archive` / `a` command. Note that all archived items are displayed in timeline view, based on their creation date.

```

> tl a

```

### Restore Items

To restore one or more items, use the `restore` / `r` command followed by the id of the target items. Note that the ids of all archived items can be seen when invoking the `archive` / `a` command. Duplicate ids are automatically filtered out.

```

> tl r 1,2

```

### List Items

To list a group of items where each item complies with a specific set of attributes, use the `list` / `l` command followed by the desired attributes. Board names along with item traits can be considered valid listing attributes. For example to list all items that belong to the default `myboard` and are pending tasks, the following could be used;

```

> tl l myboard,pending

```

The by default supported listing attributes, together with their respective aliases, are the following;

- `myboard` - Items that belong to `My board`
- `task` , `tasks` , `todo` - Items that are tasks.
- `note` , `notes` - Items that are notes.
- `pending` , `unchecked` , `incomplete` - Items that are pending tasks.
- `progress` , `started` , `begun` - Items that are in-progress tasks.
- `done` , `checked` , `complete` - Items that complete tasks.
- `canceled` - Items that are canceled.
- `star` , `starred` - Items that are starred.
- `default` , `medium` , `high` - Tasks with the given priority.

### Search Items

To search for one of more items, use the `find` / `f` command, followed by your search terms.

```

> tl f documentation

```

### Refactor IDs

To reset/rearrange the ids of all item, when they are getting to high, run the `refactor` command. The `refactor` command has no available shorter alias. This command will keep the correct order of all items but shift all ids back starting by 1.

```

> tl refactor

```

## Themes

Since Taskline 1.1.0 custom themes can be created. The colors of the individual icons and texts can be adjusted in the configuration file under theme. Valid colors are all foreground colors of [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk#colors), rgb or hex codes.

```json

"theme": {
  "colors": {
    "pale": "grey",
    "error": "#F53240",
    "task": {
      "priority": {
        "medium": "#F9BE02",
        "high": "#F53240"
      }
    },
    "icons": {
      "note": "rgb(0,0,255)",
      "success": "#02C8A7",
      "star": "#F9BE02",
      "progress": "#7EDCD5",
      "pending": "#0099CC",
      "canceled": "#F53240"
    }
  }
}

```

### Default theme

<div align="center">
  <img alt="Boards" width="70%" src="media/default-theme.png"/>
</div>

### Ocean blue theme

<div align="center">
  <img alt="Boards" width="70%" src="media/ocean-blue-theme.png"/>
</div>

## Languages

Change the language in the configuration file under language. Following languages are supported:
- english(en)
- german(de)
- spanish(es) (thanks a lot to [camilohh](https://github.com/camilohh) <3)

Hopefully with your help we are able to translate taskline in much more languages. Visit the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/perryrh0dan/taskline/blob/master/contributing.md#translating-taskline) to learn more on how to translate taskline into more languages.
